        Geographically, Darbhanga is bounded on north by Madhubani district, on south by Samastipur district, on east by
        Saharsa
        district and on west by Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur districts. Darbhanga district devoid of any hills and thus it
        has a
        vast alluvial plain. There is a gentle slope in this district from north to south direction with a depression on
        the
        centre. When it comes to divide this district on basis of natural divisions, Darbhanga can be split into four
        natural
        divisions. First Natural division, eastern part of Darbhanga district comprises of three blocks viz.
        Ghanshyampur,
        Kusheshwarasthan and Biraul. These blocks contain fresh slit which is deposited by Kosi River as this entire
        area was
        once under influence of Kosi floods until construction of Kosi embankment took place here during Second Five
        Year Plan.
        Thus, this region contains large tracts of sandy lands mostly covered with wild marsh.
